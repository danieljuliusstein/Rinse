# PocketBase Setup — Phase 1

## 1. Download & run

```bash
# From pocketbase/ directory — download binary for your OS from https://pocketbase.io/docs/
chmod +x pocketbase
./pocketbase serve --http=127.0.0.1:8090
```

Admin UI: http://127.0.0.1:8090/_/

## 2. Create admin + app user

1. On first launch, create your **admin** account (for the admin UI only).
2. Go to **Settings → Admins** is not needed — instead create an **app user**:
   - **Collections** → ensure `users` auth collection exists (default)
   - **Authentication → Users** → New user:
     - Email: `detailing@local` (or your choice)
     - Password: choose a strong password
     - Toggle **Verified** on

## 3. Import collections

**Recommended — safe CLI import** (keeps `users` auth collection):

```bash
cd pocketbase
./pocketbase migrate up
```

This applies `pb_migrations/1738780000_detailing_collections.js` in **merge mode** — only adds/updates the 8 app collections, never deletes `users` or system collections.

**Alternative — admin UI import:** Settings → Import collections → upload `pb_schema.json`

⚠️ **Before confirming**, enable **"Merge with existing collections"** (or equivalent). The default import mode deletes collections not in the JSON — including your `users` auth collection — which breaks app login.

The schema uses the **PocketBase 0.23+ format** (`fields`, flattened options, stable collection IDs for relations). API rules are included — no need to set them manually.

## 4. Configure the Next.js app

Copy env example and fill in credentials:

```bash
cp .env.local.example .env.local
```

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_PB_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8090
NEXT_PUBLIC_PB_EMAIL=detailing@local
NEXT_PUBLIC_PB_PASSWORD=your-app-user-password
```

Restart the dev server after changing `.env.local`.

## 5. Seed packages (optional)

If packages weren't auto-seeded on first app load:

```bash
PB_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8090 \
PB_EMAIL=detailing@local \
PB_PASSWORD=your-password \
node scripts/seed-packages.mjs
```

## How the app connects

1. Operator signs up or logs in at `/auth` (email + password → PocketBase user)
2. Sets a device PIN for quick unlock
3. Each user belongs to one `organizations` record; all data is scoped by `organization_id`
4. Offline writes queue in IndexedDB and flush to PocketBase on reconnect
5. Public booking: `/book/{slug}` and `/api/public/{slug}/*`

### Multi-tenant migration (existing Atlas data)

```bash
cd pocketbase && ./pocketbase migrate up

PB_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8090 \
PB_EMAIL=your-admin-user \
PB_PASSWORD=your-password \
npm run migrate:multi-tenant
```

Backfills existing records into org slug `atlas-detailing`. Then run isolation check:

```bash
npm run test:isolation
```

## How the app connected (legacy single-tenant)

1. User unlocks app with PIN
2. App authenticated with shared `NEXT_PUBLIC_PB_EMAIL` / `PASSWORD` (removed — use per-user signup)

## Verify it's working

1. Open browser devtools → Network
2. Unlock app → look for requests to `127.0.0.1:8090/api/collections/...`
3. Create a job in the app → check PocketBase admin → `jobs` collection

## Collections

| Collection | Phase 1 usage |
|---|---|
| `packages` | Read + auto-seed |
| `clients` | CRUD via jobs |
| `jobs` | Full CRUD |
| `invoices` | Read + migration |
| `app_settings` | Schema ready (Phase 2) |
| `supplies` | CRUD + auto-seed + inventory deduction on job complete |
| `overhead_expenses` | CRUD + P&L overhead proration |
| `jobs.photo_meta` | Before/after photo tagging (re-import schema if upgrading) |
| `notifications_log` | Schema ready (Phase 5) |

## Deploy (Fly.io) — Phase 6

See **`DEPLOY.md`** for full Fly.io setup (volume, HTTPS, CORS, secrets).

Quick start:

```bash
cd pocketbase
fly volumes create pb_data --region iad --size 1
fly deploy
```

Set CORS allowed origins in admin UI to match your Next.js app URL.
